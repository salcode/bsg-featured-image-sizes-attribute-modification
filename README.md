# WordPress Plugin Bootstrap Genesis Featured Image Sizes Attribute Modification

If a WordPress site is running the Bootstrap Genesis Theme and the page being displayed is using the `content-sidebar` layout, the primary column should never be any wider than `847.5px`, therefore we can modify the `sizes` attribute on the featured image to reflect this fact.

Since there is a 1024px wide image size, we don't need to load the largest 1170px image size.
